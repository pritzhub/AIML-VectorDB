# AIML-VectorDB
A vector database indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search, with capabilities like CRUD operations, metadata filtering, horizontal scaling, and serverless.
All of these new applications rely on vector embeddings, a type of vector data representation that carries within it semantic information thatâ€™s critical for the AI to gain understanding and maintain a long-term memory they can draw upon when executing complex tasks.

Embeddings are generated by AI models (such as Large Language Models) and have many attributes or features, making their representation challenging to manage. In the context of AI and machine learning, these features represent different dimensions of the data that are essential for understanding patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.

**Vector Databases:** e.g. Pinecone, Chroma, PG Vector, FAISS
